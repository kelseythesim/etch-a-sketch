# etch-a-sketch

This project is for The Odin Project. It was a great learning experience in figuring out how to manipulate the DOM. I will hopefully be able to provide some updates to make this a more interactive experience. It truly is a barebones project at this time (5/23/2023) and will hopefully only improve over time.


Thank you for looking!
